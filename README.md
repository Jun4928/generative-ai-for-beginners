# Generative AI for Beginners (Version 2) - A Course

Learn the fundamentals of building Generative AI applications with our 18-lesson comprehensive course by Microsoft Cloud Advocates.

## üå± Getting Started

This course has 18 lessons. Each lesson covers its own topic so start wherever you like!

Lessons are labeled either "Learn" lessons explaining a Generative AI concept or "Build" lessons that explain a concept and code examples in both **Python** and **TypeScript** when possible.

Each lesson also includes a "Keep Learning" section with additional learning tools.

**What You Need**

- Access to the [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-services/openai-service?) **OR** [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=python?) - _Only required to complete coding lessons_
- Basic knowledge of Python or TypeScript is helpful - \*For absolute beginners check out these [Python](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/paths/python-language/?) and [TypeScript](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/paths/build-javascript-applications-typescript/?) courses.
- A GitHub account to [fork this entire repo](https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners/fork?) to your own GitHub account

We have created a **[Course Setup](./00-course-setup/README.md?)** lesson to help you with setting up your development environment.

Don't forget to [star (üåü) this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/saving-repositories-with-stars?) to find it easier later.

## üß† Ready to Deploy?

If you are looking for more advanced code samples, check out our [collection of Generative AI Code Samples](https://aka.ms/genai-beg-code?) in both **Python** and **TypeScript**.

## üó£Ô∏è Meet Other Learners, Get Support

Join our [official AI Discord server](https://aka.ms/genai-discord?) to meet and network with other learners taking this course and get support.

## üöÄ Building a Startup?

Sign up for [Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub](https://aka.ms/genai-foundershub?) to receive **free OpenAI credits** and up to **$150k towards Azure credits to access OpenAI models through Azure OpenAI Services**.

## üôè Want to help?

Do you have suggestions or found spelling or code errors? [Raise an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners/issues?) or [Create a pull request](https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners/pulls?)

## üìÇ Each lesson includes:

- A short video introduction to the topic
- A written lesson located in the README
- Python and TypeScript code samples supporting Azure OpenAI and OpenAI API
- Links to extra resources to continue your learning
